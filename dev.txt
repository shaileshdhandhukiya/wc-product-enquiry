I want to create a custom messaging functionality for WooCommerce with the following features:

  1  Enquiry Button on Single Product Page:
        Add a button on the WooCommerce single product page to send an enquiry message via a popup form.
        Prevent non-logged-in users from sending messages by displaying a "Please log in first" prompt if they attempt to use the functionality without logging in.

   2 Restrictions for Product Owners:
        Ensure that the WooCommerce product owner cannot send an enquiry to themselves.

   3 Messaging UI with Shortcode:
        Create a shortcode to display the messaging UI in a table format with columns like:
            Name
            Subject
            Message
            Product
            Date
            Delete
        Include a "View Message" button to display the full message and provide the functionality to reply to the message sender.

   4 Notification Alert Functionality:
        Show a message notification icon with a count (e.g., "1 message received") when a new message is received.
        Enable email notifications for both the customer and the seller when an enquiry message is sent.

   5 WordPress Best Practices:
        Use WordPress standards and practices to implement the functionality, such as using Custom Post Types (CPT) or other suitable approaches.
